> Database of activities used in the Stanford Summer Engineering Academy mathematics course (2022). Created by Shintaro Fushida-Hardy, Pranav Nuti, and Megan Selbach-Allen. Please feel free to modify and incorporate any of these activities into your own courses!

The activities are arranged by topic: 
+ Introduction to Vectors
+ Perpendicularity
+ Planes
+ Subspaces, Dimension, Spans
+ Projections
+ Non-Linear Algebra
+ Meta Skills, General Skills, and Other Activities
+ Homework

Within each topic, each activity has a corresponding _readme_ file. This file describes the goals of the activity (both mathematical and meta-mathematical), the necessary materials, rough time-lines for the activity, detailed instructions, and additional tips and advice from our experiences using the activity. Some activities in the database require no supplementary materials, some require digital/non-digital materials that we don't provide, and most require digital materials that we _do_ provide.

Activities can be browsed manually in the main git branch (directory), or if you're more comfortable, you can browse them through this page (which walks the reader through the overall syllabus) and click any links.

### Introduction

Linear algebra (more specifically, vectors and their properties) is introduced through the [IOLA](https://iola.math.vt.edu/index.php) Carpet Ride Problem together with our _Maps and Distances_ activity. In this activity, students use the language of vectors to estimate distances between classmates' hometowns with physical maps.

### Perpendicularity

The first big topic of the class is perpendicularity, which is introduced through _Perpendicularity and Approximations_. This is a quick activity to motivate why perpendicularity is a useful property. Next, the dot product is discovered in _Patterns in Perpendicular Vectors_. Finally, as a class, we formally prove that the dot product detects perpendicularity in _Cosine Law_ and _Dot Product_. (Students should work on _Cosine Law_ directly before _Dot Product_, as the latter builds on the former.)

### Planes

The second big topic is planes (living in 3-dimensions), introduced through _Very Sneaky Mathematicians_. This is a spiritual successor to the Carpet Ride Problem. Next, students practice converting between different types of descriptions of planes in _Converting between Descriptions of Planes_ and _Planes Telephone_. Specifically, students convert between parametric, equational, three-point, and point-normal forms of planes.

### Subspaces, Dimension, Spans

The third big topic is bases, subspaces, dimension, and spans. The idea of bases and spanning sets is introduced in _Spanning Sets_. Next, students practice changing between bases in _Basis Ladder_, which is 
really an activity about checking whether or not a set has a redundancy. Finally students work on _Practice with Bases_ which consists of various different problems relating bases to earlier topics.

### Projections

The final big topic is projections, mostly onto lines and planes in 3-dimensions. Projections are first introduced through _Projections using a Toy Train_. Next, projections are formalised in _The Nearest Vector Interpretation and the Projection Formula_. Finally, students practice projecting vectors in _Projection onto Planes Telephone_.

### Non-Linear Algebra

Throughout the course, non-linear algebra activities were scattered between linear algebra activities. These were of several types: one was a discrete version of a linear algebra concept, three were algebra activities, and two were playful activities designed to encourage collaboration and communication, and build problem solving skills.

Early in the course, students worked on _No More Pennies_ in which they determine which values of currency can be attained by using only coins of specified values. This can be considered a discrete version of linear combinations and spans.

Students also work on algebra activies throughout the course with an emphasis on fractions, exponents, and general algebra rules respectively. Each activity is surprisingly deep, with _Egyptian Fractions_ and _Root 2 and Beyond_ emphasising problem solving.

There were also two activities designed to be playful and encourage collaboration and communication.

### Meta Skills, General Skills, and Other Activities

Each of _Good Groupwork_, _Math Resources_, _Preparing for Lecture_, and _Problem Solving_ are discussions around certain aspects of learning maths generally at university. Similarly _Honor Code_ is a discussion based activity but specific to Stanford University (in which students must adhere to the [Honor Code](https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-guidance/honor-code)).

Next, _Attending Section_, _Cheat Sheet_, and _Reading Practice_ are all opportunities for students to directly attempt tasks they'll perform in university math classes. The section worksheet for _Attending Section_ consists of problems from the MATH 51 textbook. Since the textbook is licensed under Copyright, the section worksheet cannot be redistributed here.

In _Math Words Matching Game_, students work together to learn the meanings of words like _lemma_, _conjecture_, and _theorem_. In _Secret Santa_, students write linear algebra problems for one another, and in _Skills Recap_, we discuss and celebrate all of the learning that has been done throughout the course.

### Homework

Homework largely consisted of three problem-sets with exercises from the Stanford University MATH 51 textbook. The textbook is licensed under Copyright; these problem-sets cannot be redistributed here.

Homework also incorporated short writing assignments, typically reflections on certain meta-mathematical topics.
