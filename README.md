# SSEA-Linear-Algebra-Activities
> Database of activities used in the Stanford Summer Engineering Academy mathematics course (2022). Created by Shintaro Fushida-Hardy, Pranav Nuti, and Megan Selbach-Allen. Please feel free to modify and incorporate any of these activities into your own courses!

The activities are arranged by topic: 
+ Introduction
+ Perpendicularity
+ Planes
+ Subspaces, Dimension, Spans
+ Projections
+ Non-Linear Algebra
+ Meta Skills
+ Homework

Within each topic, each activity has a corresponding _readme_ file. This file describes the goals of the activity (both mathematical and meta-mathematical), the necessary materials, rough time-lines for the activity, detailed instructions, and additional tips and advice from our experiences using the activity. Some activities in the database require no supplementary materials, some require digital/non-digital materials that we don't provide, and most require digital materials that we _do_ provide.

Activities can be browsed manually in the main git branch (directory), or if you're more comfortable, you can browse them through this page (which walks the reader through the overall syllabus) and click any links.

### Introduction

Linear algebra (more specifically, vectors and their properties) is introduced through the [IOLA](https://iola.math.vt.edu/index.php) Carpet Ride Problem together with our _Maps and Distances_ activity. In this activity, students use the language of vectors to estimate distances between classmates' hometowns with physical maps.

### Perpendicularity

The first big topic of the class is perpendicularity, which is introduced through _Perpendicularity and Approximations_. This is a quick activity to motivate why perpendicularity is a useful property. Next, the dot product is discovered in _Patterns in Perpendicular Vectors_. Finally, as a class, we formally prove that the dot product detects perpendicularity in _Cosine Law_ and _Dot Product_. (Students should work on _Cosine Law_ directly before _Dot Product_, as the latter builds on the former.)

### Planes

The second big topic is planes (living in 3-dimensions), introduced through _Very Sneaky Mathematicians_. This is a spiritual successor to the Carpet Ride Problem. Next, students practice converting between different types of descriptions of planes in _Converting between Descriptions of Planes_ and _Planes Telephone_. Specifically, students convert between parametric, equational, three-point, and point-normal forms of planes.

### Meta Skills

### Homework

Homework largely consisted of three problem-sets consisting of exercises from the Stanford University MATH 51 textbook. The textbook is licensed under Copyright; these problem-sets cannot be redistributed here.

Homework also incorporated short writing assignments, typically reflections on certain meta-mathematical topics.
