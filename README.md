# SSEA-Linear-Algebra-Activities
> Database of activities used in the Stanford Summer Engineering Academy mathematics course (2022). Created by Shintaro Fushida-Hardy, Pranav Nuti, and Megan Selbach-Allen. Please feel free to modify and incorporate any of these activities into your own courses! (Materials licensed under GPL.)

The activities are arranged by topic: 
+ Introduction
+ Perpendicularity
+ Planes
+ Subspaces, Dimension, Spans
+ Projections
+ Non-Linear Algebra
+ Meta Skills
+ Homework

Within each topic, each activity has a corresponding _readme_ file. This file describes the goals of the activity (both mathematical and meta-mathematical), the necessary materials, rough time-lines for the activity, detailed instructions, and additional tips and advice from our experiences using the activity. Some activities in the database require no supplementary materials, some require digital/non-digital materials that we don't provide, and most require digital materials that we _do_ provide.

Activities can be browsed manually in the main git branch (directory), or if you're more comfortable, you can browse them through this page (which walks the reader through the overall syllabus) and click any links.

### Introduction

### Perpendicularity

### Planes

### Subspaces, Dimension, Spans

### Projections

### Non-Linear Algebra

### Meta Skills

### Homework

Homework largely consisted of three problem-sets consisting of exercises from the Stanford University MATH 51 textbook. The textbook is licensed under Copyright; these problem-sets cannot be redistributed here.

Homework also incorporated short writing assignments, typically reflections on certain meta-mathematical topics.
