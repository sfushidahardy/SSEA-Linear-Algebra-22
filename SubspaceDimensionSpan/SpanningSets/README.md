This directory consists of a [readme file](https://github.com/sfushidahardy/SSEA-Linear-Algebra-Activities/blob/main/SubspaceDimensionSpan/SpanningSets/spanning-sets-readme.pdf) describing the details of the activity _Spanning Sets_.

There is also a document consisting of [many handouts](https://github.com/sfushidahardy/SSEA-Linear-Algebra-Activities/blob/main/SubspaceDimensionSpan/SpanningSets/spanning-sets-handout.pdf) (which are slight variations of one another).
